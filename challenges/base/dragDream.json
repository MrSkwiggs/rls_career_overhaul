  "description":"No garage. No fleet. Just a dream to go drag racing. With $500 in your pocket and $15,000 in student debt, make your dream a reality and own every property at the drag strip. You don't have a garage yet, but the drag strip lets you sleep at the tuning lanes. Maybe stop by the local logistic companies and see if they will loan you a vehicle to get to work in!",
